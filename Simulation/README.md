# About Wokwi Simulator

To validate and simulate the operation of the Density-Based Traffic Management System, we used the Wokwi Simulator. This powerful tool allows for testing and visualizing embedded systems on a web platform, eliminating the need for physical hardware. Wokwi is a free online simulator that allows users to simulate electronic circuits and embedded systems. It can be used to simulate boards like Arduino, ESP32, and STM32.

Features:
- Simulate projects: Users can simulate projects that use development boards like Arduino UNO, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico. 
- Define board behaviour: Users can define the behaviour of the development board using source code. 
- Add components: Users can add components to their design. 
- Use external libraries: Users can add external libraries to their project to extend its functionality. 
- Use with CI systems: Users can use Wokwi to run automated tests on every commit in CI systems like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI. 
- Use with VS Code: Users can use the Wokwi for Visual Studio Code extension to simulate projects directly from their code editor.
